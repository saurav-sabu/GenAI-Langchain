            "Having initially majored in film at the University of Toledo before dropping out, Cudi ventured into acting in 2009, when he was cast in the HBO series How to Make It in America. Cudi would continue to hone his acting skills, starring alongside fellow American rapper Cage, in Maniac (2011), a short horror film directed by American actor Shia LaBeouf. Cudi went on to appear in several feature films, including Goodbye World (2013), Need for Speed (2014), Entourage (2015), Bill & Ted Face the Music (2020), and Don't Look Up (2021). In addition, he has made appearances on television shows such as One Tree Hill, The Cleveland Show, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Westworld. In 2015, he was the bandleader on the IFC series Comedy Bang! Bang! and in 2020 starred in the TV drama We Are Who We Are.\n",
            "In 2020, Cudi launched production company Mad Solar, which went on to produce A Man Named Scott (2021), a documentary storying Cudi's musical career, as well as Cudi's Netflix animated special Entergalactic (2022), which Cudi co-created alongside fellow American producer Kenya Barris. In 2021, Cudi was credited as an executive producer on the award-winning film Malcolm & Marie. Mad Solar would also produce the critically acclaimed horror X (2022), which Cudi starred in, and its prequel Pearl (2022) and sequel MaXXXine (2023).\n",
            "In March 2022, Cudi revealed he would be making his feature directorial debut with the Netflix film, Teddy, a project he’s also written and in which he’ll star. Cudi announced the news in a social media post, noting that he’d been working on the project since 2013. Fellow American musicians Jay-Z and Jeymes Samuel serve as executives on the film, which was also produced by Bron Studios and Cudi's Mad Solar banner.

            "Cudi was born and raised in Ohio, and his lyrics frequently explore his introspection inspired by perceived hardships of growing up as a somewhat alienated struggling artist. Cudi began his musical career sometime during 2003, and left his hometown of Cleveland to fully embark on a musical career in New York City. In November 2007, he released the song \"Day 'n' Nite\", which garnered minor recognition on sites such as MySpace and various underground music blogs. It soon caught the attention of Plain Pat the following year, the then-manager of high-profile rapper Kanye West—whom Cudi originally met two years prior. West signed the artist to his label GOOD Music in a joint venture with Universal Motown Records, and the label would re-issue \"Day 'n' Nite\" as his debut single.\n",
